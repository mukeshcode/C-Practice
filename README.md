# C-Practice
Small projects for practice
1. STUDENT management program => Can store info about students(roll no., dept., course, year of joining). Can even query the info.
2. BANK Management Program => A simple program capable of creating new accounts, depositing/withdrawing/transacting money. Basic Turbo-C graphics is also used which makes the program more attractive.
3. ENGINE => A program which has products listed by serial numbers from "AA0" to "FF9", year of manufacturing, material used and quantity. Can visit the store, and have a look at all the products or can even retrieve a specific piece of info or a collection of info.

** NOTE = > The programs listed doesn't saves any data, i.e. the concept of file reading and writing is not used.
